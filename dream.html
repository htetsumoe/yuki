 <p> Poems about Daring to Dream
There are two kinds of dreams.</br> There are dreams that we have while asleep and dreams that we have while we are awake.</br> What is the connection between the two types? Both kinds of dreams are about the yearnings that are held deep inside us.</br> Some of these desires are so secret that we dare not share them even with our closest friends. </br>Those of us that dare to put our dreams down on paper are showing the courage and faith that they will come true.

<p>Hold fast to dreams</br>
For if dreams die</br>
Life is a broken-winged bird</br>
That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.</p>

<p>My mind wants to interpret
All my dreams.

My heart wants to love
All my dreams.

My soul wants to fulfil
All my dreams</p>

<p>All people dream, but not equally.</br>
Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their mind,
Wake in the morning to find that it was vanity.</br>

But the dreamers of the day are dangerous people,
For they dream their dreams with open eyes,
And make them come true.</p>
